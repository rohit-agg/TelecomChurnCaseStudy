## General Information
In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. 

#### Objective
As a data scientist, your task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

## Approach

Following is the step-by-step approach followed to solve the given problem statement:
1. Data Understanding
1. Feature Engineering
1. Data Visualisation (EDA)
1. Data Preparation
1. Model Building
    1. Logistic Regression
    1. Random Forest
    1. XGBoost Classifier
    1. PCA + Logistic Regression
    1. PCA + Random Forest
    1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
1. Model Selection, Evaluation and Prediction
1. Test Data Analysis
1. Conclusions

## Conclusions
- Random Forest and XGBoost resulted in an accuracy of 94.436%
- Using PCA was not helpful in improving the accuracy
- Logistic regression alone or with PCA was not helpful in achieving good accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python (ver 3.12.7)
- NumPy (ver 1.26.4)
- Pandas (ver 2.2.2)
- MatplotLib (ver 3.9.2)
- Seaborn (ver 0.13.2)
- XGBoost (ver 2.1.3)
- sklearn (ver 1.5.1)
- statsmodel (ver 0.14.2)
